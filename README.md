## Form Validation

The project includes client-side and server-side validation:

```javascript
$("form").each(function() {
  var form = $(this);
  if (form.length) {
    form.validate({
      rules: {
        phone: {
          required: true,
          number: true,
        },
        email: {
          required: true,
          email: true,
        },
      },
      // Additional validation rules...
    });
  }
});
```

## Lead Processing

Leads are processed through the following flow:

1. Form submission triggers AJAX request to `savecon.php`
2. Server-side validation occurs
3. Captcha verification ensures authentic submissions
4. Data is saved to the database
5. Lead information is forwarded to the CRM via API
6. User is redirected to the thank you page

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

- **Captcha Errors**: Ensure your captcha keys are correctly configured
- **Form Submission Failures**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- **CRM Integration Issues**: Verify API credentials and formatting
